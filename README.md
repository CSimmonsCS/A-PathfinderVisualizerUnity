# A-PathfinderVisualizerUnity
This project uses C# and Unity to build an A* Pathfinding Visualizer.  The start node begins at the bottom left-hand size of the application.  The pathfinder will find the quickest route to a point where the user clicks on the the gridmap, which is based on the hCost, gCost, &amp; fCost.  The user can build walls to create obstacles for the pathfinder.  By repeatedly pressing the 'spacebar' button, the application reads each node one-by-one and evaluates the path.  Each green-node notes the current node.  A red-node notes a node that has already been read.  A blue-node notes a node that is to be read.  After calculating the path, the application shows the path using all green-nodes.
